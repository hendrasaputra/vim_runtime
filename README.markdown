    This is my personal configuration of amix's runtime idea for a Vim configuration that is multi-platform independent.
What you see here is under current construction; it is messy and experimental. For example, bak_vimrc and bak_gvimrc are backup files for a different config. The vim_bak directory is also a backup configuration.
